    <h2> Mahjong </h2>

    <p>I love playing <b><i>Mahjong!</i></b> Specifically Riichi Mahjong. I love how <b><i>trilling</i></b> the game is 
        when you have to think about what tile will your opponent 
        drop and what hand do you need to build to win the game and get the most points. </p>

    <h2> Drawing </h2>
    <!-- add photo here-->
    <img src = "Resources/maxresdefault.jpg" alt = "not my drawing" width = 1000 height = 1000></img>
    <p> Truth be told, I'm not too good at drawing, 
        but I plan to get better so I can make my game cheaper 
        in the long run as I plan to develop games solo for a hobby.
        <i>Want to see my drawings?</i> Maybe later when I get better.</p>

    <h2> Photography </h2>

    <p> While it might seem shocking to some of my friends, 
        I actually <b><i>love</i></b> doing Photography, specifically <b><i>Urban Photography!</i></b> 
        I just love the aesthetic of the urban space and the contrast 
        between the common man and the towering structures of corporate entities. </p>

    <p> Here are some photos I took in the past if you were curious: </p>
