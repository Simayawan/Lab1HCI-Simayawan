                    when you have to think about what tile will your opponent 
                    drop and what hand do you need to build to win the game and get the most points. </p>

                    but I plan to get better so I can make my game cheaper 
                    in the long run as I plan to develop games solo for a hobby.

                    I actually <b><i>love</i></b> doing Photography, specifically <b><i>Urban Photography!</i></b> 
                    I just love the aesthetic of the urban space and the contrast 
                    between the common man and the towering structures of corporate entities. </p>
